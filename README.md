Then, **Dr. Hardeep Singh Rai**, Controller of Examination, shared his experience with the students. He started his lecture by asking students to fill out a google form writing "What comes to their mind when they hear the word: EXAMINATION?". There were multiple answers like Opportunity, Study, Hardwork but one answer was the most common i.e., Fear. Then, he told us not to fear from examination. We just need to attend classes to get good marks. He also shared his experience of working as Mentor with several students for Google Summer of Code. He also gave an option to students to learn from him. Around 60 students enrolled for it. Our first task was to make our Profile and Share our experience at GNDEC using Github pages and Markdown. It has been a pleasure to be learning from him and being a part of a community called Code GNE where I am exploring certain things which I did not even know about. 

## Day 3: 

Day 3 again started in the Auditorium. **Dr. Randhir Singh** was first speaker of the day. He briefed us about Induction Program and various criteria for passing it. He explained that all the students need to pass a English Proficiency Test, Mathematics Test, submit an e-certificate in any course and a report about experience at GNDEC using Github Pages, which was earlier only limited to students of Code GNE. He also told students about the upcoming Mid Semester Examinations and marks distrubution for it. 

Then, **Dr. Pyara Lal Garg**, Former Paediatric Surgery Professor, addressed the students. He told us that the times have changed but one thing that has not changed is the learning attitude of humans. It has been the biggest reasons behind enormous developments that the mankind has been able to make. He also explained that you are bound to face problems when you start. But once you have started and you are determined enough to do it, you can achieve any goal in your life. He said that we always look for the negatives while ignoring the positive side. When we start looking at the positive side of the matter, the life becomes much better. He explained that we must never blame someone before introspecting ourselves.

The final speaker of the day was **Mr. Pancham Singh, a fourth-year Mechanical Engineering student at GNE**. He provided insights on body language, explaining **7-38-55 rule** which means that words convey only 7% of a message, while voice tone and body language account for 38% and 55%, respectively. He also presented a few slides on how to interpret what another person's body language is communicating, such as whether they are aggressive, defensive, interested, or disinterested in listening. He also shared how to identify between real and fake smiles. 

## Day 4: 

We were having our classes on Day 4. The first class of the day was of English. Sir and Ma'am told us to introduce ourselves to the class. But before that, they gave us some time to prepare for it. Some of the students gave their introduction to the class and the teachers gave their honest opinion on it so that they can improve it. I also prepared my introduction but did not get the chance to speak it as the time was limited. I also learnt a new phrase **Break the Ice** which means to say or do something that makes others relaxed.

We were also asked to make our own template and submit it via Google Forms. 

Then, we headed to Workshop Hall for Mathematics Class. The teacher taught us some concepts of integration which includes ILATE rule for integrating two different functions in multiplication, Partial Fractions etc. He also gave us some questions to practice. 

After that, we went to the Auditorium Hall for a session on NCC and NSS. **Dr. Harwinder Singh, Associate Officer, NCC,** explained us about the NCC. He explained the importance of co-curricular and extra-curricular activities alongside academics. Co-curricular and extra-curricular activities are as important as academics for overall development but participation in these activities should not come at the cost of academics. He briefed us about the camps that take place in and outside the college for NCC cadets. He also explained about 10 Core Life Skills recommended by WHO: 

1. Self-awareness
2. Empathy

At last, **Er. Jasvir Singh Grewal, Co-ordinator, NSS,** conducted a session on NSS. He gave example of Bhai Kanhaiya Ji who gave water to all the thirsty troops during war including the enemy troops. Some Sikhs complained about this to Guru Gobind Singh Ji and Guru Ji called Bhai Kanhaiya Ji. WHen Bhai Ji came, Guru Ji asked, "Is it true what I have heard? Are you giving water to the enemy?" Bhai Kanhaiya​​​​​​​ Ji replied, "O My Beloved Guru Ji, yes it is true. When I look into the faces of all these wounded men, all I see is you. I have to serve them because all I see is you and God in them." Guru Gobind Singh was very happy hearing him and smiled as he said, "You are right and you have shown me today that you really understand the Guru's words and live them." Guru Ji then announced to all his Khalsa: "Bhai Kanhaiya​​​​​​​ has understood the teachings correctly. My Beloved Sikhs, try all you can to learn like this. The lessons that Gurbani teaches are priceless." Guru Ji then gave some herbal medicine to Bhai Kanhaiya​​​​​​​ Ji and told him, "From now on, put this on the wounds of all those who need it." And Bhai Kanhaiya​​​​​​​ Ji began using this salve to serve all the wounded on the battlefield with love. He gave us this example to motivate us to be a part of NSS and do our part for the betterment of the society. He also told us about NSS's initiatives like Planting Trees, Blood Donation Camps, Rain Water Harvesting etc. He also said that we should not only plant more tress but also care for them. Their survival is important. 

## Day 6: 

Day 6 started in the auditorium with a lecture from **Er. Kanwardeep Kalra**. She started the session with an act showing four different candidates appearing for a job interview. Candidate 1 was possessed good skills but was arrogant. Second Candidate was under-confidence. Third and Fourth Candidate possessed both skills and confidence and also behaved properly. This act showed the importance of good behaviour and confidence not just in job interview but in the real world as well. She explained the importance of Soft Skills in life which was earlier demonstrated through the act as well. Then, she explained about the Circle of Life revolving around 'C'. 

Childhood ---> Campus ---> College ---> Career ---> Compensation. 

Afterwards, **Jaswinder Singh, Incharge, IAPT,** interacted with the students. He demonstrated several physics experiment live on stage and explained the physics behind them. He gave us all a unique trick to remember the number of bones in human body and their distributions. The trick was **26-27-28**. 

> 26 bones in each foot (52 in both)

> 27 bones in each hand (54 in both)

> 28 bones in human skull 

> 26+26 = 52 bones in chest and back

> 5 bones in each arm and each leg 

> All this adds to total 206 bones in human body. 

He also demonstrated how electrostatics force is more powerful than gravity. For this, he used a balloon and a plumbers tape. He charged the balloons by rubbing it against his hand and the tape by rubbiing it with fingers. The balloon was attracted towards the other side of tape which was oppositely charged and remained in air with only support from tape which proves that electrostatics force is more powerful than gravity. He conducted several experiments including explaining lens and surface tension. It was a mind blowing session with him and everyone enjoyed a lot. 

At last, we had a department vist and interaction. We went to the Computer Science department building and the teacher took us to the respective rooms according to our sections. Firstly, we were given a presentation about the department and the alumni from our department. We were given instructions about how we should be spending our next 4 years, examinations, internships and placements. We were also briefed about two societies being run by the department: The Computer Society of India - GNDEC and The Data Science Club. We were also given a complete tour of the labs and the server room. This was the first time, I was watching a server room physically. 

## Day 7: 

On Day 7, we were having classes. Our first class was of Mathematics. In the class, the teacher taught us about differential equations. He taught the concepts of Variable Separable Differential Equation, Homogeneous Differential Equation and Linear Differential Equation. He also discussed several questions on these topics in the class to strengthen our knowledge of the concept. 

Afterwards, we were having a Peer Interaction about College. One of our senior from 2nd year conducted this interaction. He told us about the common mistakes students make in the first year, examination pattern, what to do and what not and the importance of first year. He shared his experience on how the new students should study and get good marks in the examinations. 

## Day 8: 

The First Speaker of the day was **Mr. Gauravdeep Singh, Founder & Chairman, Initiators of Change.** He shared his life story, from failures to success and how difficulties in his life led to the start of Initiators of Change, a national award winning non profit charitable organisation working on leadership development, education for all, social-political awareness of youth and disaster management in the states of Punjab and Delhi. He pointed out that we tend to focus on our flaws and shortcomings, overlooking our positive qualities. He also said that God does everything for a greater good. He shared his story when he had to drop out of College due to financial instability in his house but then he pursued his education in a government college in Ludhiana and got the idea to start an NGO for the society. Then, he started **Initiators of Change** in 2015 with just four members and today the foundation has over 3000 members and has been helping thousands of people in Punjab and Delhi. They have adopted 100 schools and changed the lives of over 5000 students. His session was indeed very knowledgable and changed my view point towards life. 

Afterwards, **Er. Lakhveer Singh, Coordinator, Centre for Multi-Faceted Learning (CML)** condducted a session on CML and NPTEL. He first briefed students about CML and how one can transform their personality by participating in the activities conducted by CML.

## Day 9

On Day 9, firstly, we were having **Peer to Peer Interaction on Excel and Artificial Intelligence.** They talked about AI vs Generative AI and explained that AI excels at  solving well-defined problems, performing repetitive tasks, and making precise calculations and predictions whereas Generative AI generates original content, like images, text, music, video, or software code, based on patterns it identifies in large data sets. They also explained different types of Machine Learning: Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforced Learning. In supervised learning, there is a well defined named dataset while in unsupervised learning, there is no well defined dataset. In Reinforced Learning, algorithms learn to react to an environment on their own. It is rapidly growing and moreover producing a variety of learning algorithms. Then, they taught us about Several Excel Commands such as

1. SUM
2. SUMIF
3. COUNT
4. COUNTA
5. COUNTBLANK
6. WELOOKUP

Afterwards, we had a **Mathematics Test of Differentiation, Integration and Differential Equation.**

## Day 10

This was the last day of Student Induction Program. The first speaker of the day was **Dr. Kanwalpreet Kaur Bhatt, Homeopathic Practitioner and Meditation Counsellor.** She shared her valuable insights on health and meditation with us. She told us that emotions have a strong impact on our health. When our emotions are out of balance, it often affects our bodies and can lead to various illnesses. For example, feeling stressed or anxious for a long time can cause headaches, stomach problems, or even more serious conditions like high blood pressure. Keeping our emotions in check is important for staying healthy. She also showed us a video on how to do meditation in the right way and how effective it can be for healing our body. After the video was finished, she told all of us to do meditation for around 15 minutes and taught us the right method to meditate practically. She also recommended two books which we should read: Secret Book and The Power of Sub-Conscious Mind.
