# My Experience at GNDEC
## Day 1: 

Day 1 started with a lot of enthusiasm. I was really excited to go to the college. The college started on a positive note seeking the blessing of the Waheguru with Shabad Kirtan and Ardaas at the college Gurudwara. 

Afterwards, at the college auditorium, **IAS Harleen Kaur** was the first speaker of the day. She taught us that we can grab opportunities only if we are looking for them. She also shared about four major skills which every student should learn during their college time which include Subject Skills, Language Skills, People Skills & Life Skills. 

Then, **Principal Dr. Sehijpal Singh** shared his words of wisdom with the us. He shared about process by which we can learn skills during their time at the college, how we should be learning for the next four years. 

At last, **Dr. S B Singh**, Former Principal, shared his valuable insights and experience. He shared about the strong alumni network of the college. He also stressed on the great Student-Teacher relation in the college.

## Day 2:

**Dr. Arvind Dhingra**, Head of the Technical Activities, was the first speaker of the day. He explained about "Who is a member?" and various types of members:
1. Member
2. Active Member
3. Executive Member
4. Office Bearer
 
He also briefed us about various societies operating in the college: 
* SCIE
* ISTE
* ITIAN Club
* E-cell and IIC
* Data Science Club
* SAE etc.

Then, **Dr. Hardeep Singh Rai**, Controller of Examination, shared his experience with the students. He started his lecture by asking students to fill out a google form writing "What comes to their mind when they hear the word: EXAMINATION?". There were multiple answers like Opportunity, Study, Hardwork but one answer was the most common i.e., Fear. Then, he told us not to fear from examination. We just need to attend classes to get good marks. He also shared his experience of working as Mentor with several students for Google Summer of Code. He also gave an option to students to learn from him. Around 60 students enrolled for it. Our first task was to make our Profile and Share our experience at GNDEC using Github pages and Markdown. It has been a pleasure to be learning from him and being a part of a community called Code GNE where I am exploring certain things which I did not even know about. 

## Day 3: 

Day 3 again started in the Auditorium. **Dr. Randhir Singh** was first speaker of the day. He briefed us about Induction Program and various criteria for passing it. He explained that all the students need to pass a English Proficiency Test, Mathematics Test, submit an e-certificate in any course and a report about experience at GNDEC using Github Pages, which was earlier only limited to students of Code GNE. He also told students about the upcoming Mid Semester Examinations and marks distrubution for it. 

Then, **Dr. Pyara Lal Garg**, Former Paediatric Surgery Professor, addressed the students. He told us that the times have changed but one thing that has not changed is the learning attitude of humans. It has been the biggest reasons behind enormous developments that the mankind has been able to make. He also explained that you are bound to face problems when you start. But once you have started and you are determined enough to do it, you can achieve any goal in your life. He said that we always look for the negatives while ignoring the positive side. When we start looking at the positive side of the matter, the life becomes much better. He explained that we must never blame someone before introspecting ourselves. 

Afterwards, **Mr. Sony Goyal**, Founder of Mission CAT and a motivation speaker, provided clear guidance about setting and achieving our goals. He provided us with two success mantras: 
1. Always Give your 100%
2. Do what you love and love what you do

He also shared another mantra called LIFE:

**L**earn
<br> 
**I**nquire
<br>
**F**uture
<br>
**E**xplore

The final speaker of the day was Mr. Pancham Singh, a fourth-year Mechanical Engineering student at GNE. He provided insights on body language, explaining **7-38-55 rule** which means that words convey only 7% of a message, while voice tone and body language account for 38% and 55%, respectively. He also presented a few slides on how to interpret what another person's body language is communicating, such as whether they are aggressive, defensive, interested, or disinterested in listening. He also shared how to identify between real and fake smiles. 

## Day 4: 

We were having our classes on Day 4. The first class of the day was of English. Sir and Ma'am told us to introduce ourselves to the class. But before that, they gave us some time to prepare for it. Some of the students gave their introduction to the class and the teachers gave their honest opinion on it so that they can improve it. I also prepared my introduction but did not get the chance to speak it as the time was limited. I also learnt a new phrase **Break the Ice** which means to say or do something that makes others relaxed. 

The second class was of Public Speaking conducted by Mr Panchan Singh, 4th year Mechanical Student. He also told us to prepare a topic of our choice in any language and speak on it for 3 minutes infront of the class. I prepared it on my journey as a cricket fan. He shared some public speaking basics and answered my question about how to capture the audience's attention.

## Day 5:

On Day 5, firstly, we were having a peer interaction on Canva. Our seniors introduced us to Canva which is a free to use online graphics tool. They taught us the basics of Canva, how we can create our own templates or edit the existing ones to create visually appealing designs which can be used for commercial purposes as well. We were also asked to make our own template and submit it via Google Forms. 

Then, we headed to Workshop Hall for Mathematics Class. The teacher taught us some concepts of integration which includes ILATE rule for integrating two different functions in multiplication, Partial Fractions etc. He also gave us some questions to practice. 

After that, we went to the Auditorium Hall for a session on NCC and NSS. Dr. Harwinder Singh, Associate Officer, NCC, explained us about the NCC. He explained the importance of co-curricular and extra-curricular activities alongside academics. Co-curricular and extra-curricular activities are as important as academics for overall development but participation in these activities should not come at the cost of academics. He briefed us about the camps that take place in and outside the college for NCC cadets. He also explained about 10 Core Life Skills recommended by WHO: 

1. Self-awareness
2. Empathy
3. Critical thinking
4. Creative thinking
5. Decision making
6. Problem Solving
7. Effective communication
8. Interpersonal relationship
9. Coping with stress
10. Coping with emotions

At last, Er. Jasvir Singh Grewal, Co-ordinator, NSS, conducted a session on NSS. He gave example of Bhai Kanhaiya Ji who gave water to all the thirsty troops during war including the enemy troops. Some Sikhs complained about this to Guru Gobind Singh Ji and Guru Ji called Bhai Kanhaiya Ji. WHen Bhai Ji came, Guru Ji asked, "Is it true what I have heard? Are you giving water to the enemy?" Bhai Kanhaiya​​​​​​​ Ji replied, "O My Beloved Guru Ji, yes it is true. When I look into the faces of all these wounded men, all I see is you. I have to serve them because all I see is you and God in them." Guru Gobind Singh was very happy hearing him and smiled as he said, "You are right and you have shown me today that you really understand the Guru's words and live them." Guru Ji then announced to all his Khalsa: "Bhai Kanhaiya​​​​​​​ has understood the teachings correctly. My Beloved Sikhs, try all you can to learn like this. The lessons that Gurbani teaches are priceless." Guru Ji then gave some herbal medicine to Bhai Kanhaiya​​​​​​​ and told him, "From now on, put this on the wounds of all those who need it." And Bhai Kanhaiya​​​​​​​ began using this salve to serve all the wounded on the battlefield with love. He gave us this example to motivate us to be a part of NSS and do our part for the betterment of the society. He also told us about NSS's initiatives like Planting Trees, Blood Donation Camps, Rain Water Harvesting etc. He also said that we should not only plant more tress but also care for them. Their survival is important. 

## Day 6: 

Day 6 started in the auditorium with a lecture from Er. Kanwardeep Kalra. She started the session with an act showing four different candidates appearing for a job interview. Candidate 1 was possessed good skills but was arrogant. Second Candidate was under-confidence. Third and Fourth Candidate possessed both skills and confidence and also behaved properly. This act showed the importance of good behaviour and confidence not just in job interview but in the real world as well. Then she explained about the Circle of Life revolving around 'C'. Childhood ---> Campus ---> College ---> Career ---> Compensation. She also explained the importance of Soft Skills in life which was earlier demonstrated through the act as well. 

Afterwards, Jaswinder Singh, Incharge, IAPT, interacted with the students. He demonstrated several physics experiment live on stage and explained the physics behind them. He gave us all a unique trick to remember the number of bones in human body and their distributions. The trick was **26-27-28**. 

26 bones in each foot (52 in both)
27 bones in each hand (54 in both)
28 bones in human skull 
26+26 = 52 bones in chest and back
5 bones in each arm and each leg 
All this adds to total 206 bones in human body. 

He also demonstrated how electrostatics force is more powerful than gravity. For this, he used a balloon and a plumbers tape. He charged the balloons by rubbing it against his hand and the tape by rubbiing it with fingers. The balloon was attracted towards the other side of tape which was oppositely charged and remained in air with only support from tape which proves that electrostatics force is more powerful than gravity. He conducted several experiments including explaining lens and surface tension. It was a mind blowing session with him and everyone enjoyed a lot. 

At last, we had a department vist and interaction. We went to the Computer Science department building and the teacher took us to the respective rooms according to our sections. Firstly, we were given a presentation about the department and the alumni from our department. We were given instructions about how we should be spending our next 4 years, examinations, internships and placements. We were also briefed about two societies being run by the department: The Computer Society of India - GNDEC and The Data Science Club. We were also given a complete tour of the labs and the server room. This was the first time, I was watching a server room physically.
