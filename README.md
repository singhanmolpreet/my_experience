# My Experience at GNDEC
## Day 1: 
Day 1 started with a lot of enthusiasm. I was really excited to go to the college. The college started on a positive note seeking the blessing of the Waheguru with Shabad Kirtan and Ardaas at the college Gurudwara. 
Then at the college auditorium, IAS Harleen Kaur was the first speaker. She taught us that we can grab opportunities only if we are looking for them. She also shared about four major skills which every student should learn during their college time which include Subject Skills, Language Skills, People Skills & Life Skills.

Then, Principal Dr. Sehijpal Singh shared his words of wisdom with the us. He shared about process by which we can learn skills during their time at the college, how we should be learning for the next four years.

At last, Dr. S B Singh, Former Principal, shared his valuable insights and experience. He shared about the strong alumni network of the college. He also stressed on the great Student-Teacher relation in the college.

## Day 2:
Dr. Arvind Dhingra, Head of the Technical Activities, was the first speaker of the day. He explained about "Who is a member?" and various types of members:
1. Member
2. Active Member
3. Executive Member
4. Office Bearer
 
He also briefed us about various societies operating in the college: 
* SCIE
* ISTE
* ITIAN Club
* E-cell and IIC
* Data Science Club
* SAE etc.

Then, Dr. Hardeep Singh Rai, Controller of Examination, shared his experience with the students. He started his lecture by asking students to fill out a google form writing "What comes to their mind when they hear the word: EXAMINATION?". There were multiple answers like Opportunity, Study, Hardwork but one answer was the most common i.e., Fear. Then, he told us not to fear from examination. We just need to attend classes to get good marks.
